<h1>Movie_Recommender üìΩÔ∏è</h1>
<ul>
    <li> This is my first ML project! And after 5 hours of watching gruelling tutotrials online, this is the outcome! </li>
    <li>The program reads a file called tmdb_5000_movies.csv that has movie details like titles, plots, genres, and keywords of movies</li>
    <li>It cleans the data by turning the genres and keywords into simple text and combining them with the movie‚Äôs overview (description).</li>
    <li>It uses a tool called TF-IDF to turn all that text into numbers, so the computer can understand and compare movies.</li>
    <li>When you type your favourite movie, the program finds it and shows the top 5 movies that have the most similar story or theme. </li>
    <li>Then it uses cosine similarity to measure how close or similar each movie is to every other one.</li>
  <li> This was my first time using cosine similarity! Apparently, it compares movie vectors and gives me the result of the ones that match the most!?</li>
  </ul>
